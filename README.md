# Bikesharing_Analysis
Using Tableau to creat Worksheets Dashboards and stories from New York City Bike_sharing Data.

# Overview

Having taken a bike tour of New York City and explored the city on two wheels, we have an idea to do something similar in Des Moines. The data we obtained can be used to predict whether the bike-share company idea will work in Des Moines. Kate also got a potential investor who was interested in investing. Investors had to be convinced that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business plan. Our proposal was solidified by a bike trip analysis required by one of our key stakeholders
